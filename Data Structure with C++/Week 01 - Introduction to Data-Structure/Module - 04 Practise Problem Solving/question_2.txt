Write down Three Limitations of the array
which can be solved by the use of Linked List___?????

1.fixed size:
        array has fixed size it can add more data node
        linked-list isnt fixed its can add size,,

2.serial wise  memory allocation:
        array created and take memory serial wise in memory.
        like example for int :
                100 104 108 112 116 220
        but linked-list store memory when they get space randomly 
        and connet each others with next pointer 

3. insert and delleting value:
            in array insert a  value and dellet a value is costly 
            but in linked-list in can easily do this...
