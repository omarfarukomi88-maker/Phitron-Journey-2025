Why do you think linked-list requires more memory than an array
when storing the same number of elements?

array store only value.suppose one int 4 byte store in array.
but linked-list there is also store a pointer besides value.
in node value there is 4+4 byte memory are allocated

so i think that reason linked-list store more memory than array....
